# News-Article-Query
In today’s digital era, the exponential growth of online news content presents a major challenge 
for researchers, journalists, and analysts in efficiently extracting relevant information. 
Traditional keyword-based search engines often fall short in providing contextually accurate 
insights, leading to information overload and time-consuming manual filtering. This project 
proposes an AI-powered research tool designed to intelligently query and retrieve answers from 
online news articles using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and semantic search 
techniques. 
The system enables users to input URLs of news articles and pose natural language questions, 
receiving precise, context-aware responses drawn directly from the content. It utilizes 
OpenAI’s embedding models to convert article sentences and user queries into semantic 
vectors, which are then indexed and retrieved using the FAISS similarity search engine. The 
integration of cosine similarity ensures that results are ranked based on contextual relevance 
rather than mere word overlap. 
A user-friendly Streamlit interface supports seamless interaction, allowing non-technical users 
to engage with the system intuitively.
